# Combinational-logic-based-traffic-light

In this project, a controller is designed for traffic lights at an intersection of two equally busy roads. 
It is assumed that the traffic on both roads are equal, therefore each road will be given equal time to allow
traffic flow. The traffic light controller consists of three components: 
- Sequential logic: Determines what state the traffic light controller is in.
- Timing circuit: which provides a clock pulse and determines how long each state will last
- Sequential logic: which determines what the next state will be.
